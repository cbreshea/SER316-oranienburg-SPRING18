Meeting Notes 2/7:

TODO:
- fix mac minimize (be sure instructor knows if we have OS issues)
- make meeting notes for github
- add more to sprint wiki
- create quality policies for git (git and unit testing)
	- quality: what are you planning to do for the unit testing?

Future Notes:
- need a develpment branch (intermediate branch)
- have good commit messages
- use correct branch names (branch name: us_(number))
- lines of code goal is more for quality code, not copy-pasting
